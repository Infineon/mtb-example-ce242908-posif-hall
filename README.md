# PSOC&trade; Control C1 MCU: POSIF hall

This code example demonstrates a position interface (POSIF) module in hall sensor mode and uses the capture and compare unit 4 (CCU40) module to determine the speed of rotation of the motor. An interrupt is generated every time, a correct or incorrect hall event is detected. The SysTick timer is used to display the timing between the two correct hall events and incorrect hall event occurrence on the terminal. Instead of physically connecting the motor, the example demonstrates the use of the POSIF_HALL module using simulation via the PWM signals (CCU80).

## Using the code example


### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*)

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target)

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Application(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**

      > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you

   b. Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box

      > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process

</details>

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[POSIF hall](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ce242908-posif-hall)" application with the desired name "POSIF hall" configured for the *KIT_PSC1M3_EVK* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_PSC1M3_EVK --app-id mtb-example-ce242908-posif-hall --user-app-name POSIF hall --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Design and implementation

The application uses the 'CYBSP_DEBUG_UART' resource to print messages in a UART terminal emulator. This resource is configured by the ModusToolbox&trade; software UART personality. The retargeting of the standard I/O to the CYBSP_DEBUG_UART port is included in the example. After using `retarget_io_init`, messages can be printed on the terminal by simply using `printf` commands.

The POSIF module is configured in hall sensor mode. Hall input signals are connected to the POSIF module input ports.

The application uses a CCU4 slice configured using the CCU4 personality. The CAPTURE_0 CCU4 slice is configured in capture mode. It will capture the timer value on the rising edge of the POSIF0.OUT1 signal. The DELAY_0 CCU4 slice is configured in compare mode. It starts a timer that is configured in single-shot mode. The status signal is connected to POSIF.HSDA to delay the input sampling to reject noise that might appear at those positions.

The POSIF module checks for the hall sequence 1, 3, 2, 6, 4, and 5. Each time a correct hall event is detected, an interrupt is generated and the timing between the two correct hall events is displayed on the terminal. It also checks for the occurrence of an incorrect hall event interrupt and displays it on the terminal.
